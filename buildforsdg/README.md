Team-109 Crowdfunding App (Frontend)

About

The app is a platform that will mobilize financial resources via crowdfunding individuals and corporations. Such raised funds will be used for the empowering the educationally disadvantaged youths to set up a small business or to acquire a trade or craft skill to set up small enterprise.


Why

Nigeria, as of 2020, seems to be the poverty capital of the world!. With an unemployed young population of over 30 million, it is like a powder keg just waiting for a spark to explode. A proof to this fact, is the existence of the globally, notorious, terrorist groups like Boko Haram as well as the recently formed one-million robbery gang terrorizing citizens at their homes during the lockdown period of covid-19 pandemic. Available data suggest that 50 per cent of the unemployed youth across Nigeria have not received any formal education. The high poverty and unemployment level among this set of educationally disadvantaged youths needs to be addressed. There must be a deliberate effort by all of us to join hands via a crowdfunding medium, in order to help these youths achieve financial freedom else our existence is threatened!! 


Usage

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
